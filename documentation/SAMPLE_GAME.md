This is a quick rundown of what a sample game could look like between Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
All of the cards and Heroes are made up.

The order of the player list is Alice > Bob > Charlie > Alice

Alice is playing the hero Markuth:
5 starting life total
4 card starting hand
All Knights gain +1 damage
Bounty: Summon a Knight in your protecting and invading queues

Bob is playing the hero Allalune:
4 starting life total
6 card starting hand
Once per turn you may pay 2 devotion to gain 2 life
Bounty: Gain 4 life

Charlie is playing the hero D'dak
3 starting life total
5 card starting hand
Start the game with 1 Energy
Bounty: Gain 1 Energy

TURN ONE SETUP:
All players devote a card
Alice plays the Zergling spell in Bob's invading queue for 1 devotion
Bob plays a Wall in his protecting queue for 1 devotion
Charlie plays a Doombot in Alice's invading queue for 1 devotion and 1 energy

TURN ONE RESOLUTION:
Alice's realm looks like this:
Invading: Doombot (4/4)
Protecting: nothing

Bob's realm looks like this:
Invading: Zergling, Zergling
Protecting: Wall

Charlie's realm looks like this:
Invading: nothing
Protecting: nothing

TURN ONE COMBAT:
In Alice's realm, Charlie's Doombot hits her directly for 4 damage, sending her to 1 life.

In Bob's realm, Alice's two Zerglings hit Bob's wall for 2, bringing it down to 2 life.

In Charlie's realm, nothing happens.

TURN TWO SETUP:
All players devote a card
Alice plays the Big Game Hunter spell in her own realm for 2 devotion
Bob plays a Knight in Charlie's realm for 1 and a knight in his own realm for 1
Charlie plays a Rapid Strike spell on his Doombot in Alice's realm for 2 devotion

TURN TWO RESOLUTION:
In Alice's realm, the first card that gets resolved is her own Big Game Hunter spell, killing Charlie's Doombot.
Charlie's Rapid Strike spell now has nothing to target, so it just goes to waste without doing anything.
Alice's realm is now empty

Bob's realm looks like this:
Invading: Zergling, Zergling
Protecting: Wall (which has already taken 2 damage), Knight

Charlie's realm looks like this:
Invading: Knight
Protecting: nothing

TURN TWO COMBAT:
In Alice's realm, nothing happens. She's still hanging on with 1 life.

In Bob's realm, his Wall falls to Alice's Zerglings, but his Knight kills Alice's frontlining Zergling
without taking any damage itself (because the Zerglings both attacked the Wall). Bob still has 4 life.

In Charlie's realm, Bob's knight hits Charlie for 2 damage, bringing him down to 1 life.

TURN THREE SETUP:
All players devote a card.
Alice plays one Knight in her realm as a protector, and 2 Knights in Bob's realm as invaders for a total of 3 devotion.
Bob spends 2 devotion to use his Hero's power to heal him by 2
Charlie plays a Rager in his own realm as a protector for 1 devotion and spends his remaining 2 devotion gaining an Energy for next turn

TURN THREE RESOLUTION:
Alice's realm looks like this:
Invading: nothing
Protecting: Knight (with a +1/+0 bonus from her Hero's power)

Bob's realm looks like this:
Invading: Zergling, Knight, Knight (both with +1/+0)
Protecting: Knight

Bob has also healed, bringing him up to 6 life.

Charlie's realm looks like this:
Invading: Knight
Protecting: Rager

TURN THREE COMBAT:
In Alice's realm, nothing happens because there are no invaders. She still has 1 life.

In Bob's realm, his protecting Knight kills Alice's Zergling before himself being killed by Alice's first Knight (Bob's knight doesn't
deal damage to Alice's knight because it spent its attack hitting Alice's Zergling). Alice's second Knight has a no defenders, so it
hits Bob directly for 3 damage, bringing him down to 3 life.

In Charlie's realm, his Rager and Bob's Knight kill each other. He still has 1 life.

TURN FOUR SETUP:
All players devote a card.
Alice plays a Big Wolf in Bob's invading realm, and she casts a Biggening Potion on the Knight
in her own realm for 4 devotion
Bob plays an Elf and a Fireball spell in his realm targeting Alice's frontlining Knight for 4 devotion
Charlie plays a Dreadnaught in Alice's realm for 4 devotion and 1 Energy (he's really hoping that Bob is playing defense this turn)

TURN FOUR RESOLUTION:
Alice's realm looks like this:
Invading: Dreadnaught
Protecting: Knight (+1/+0 from the Hero power, +1/+1 from the Biggening potion so hes a 4/3)

Bob's realm looks like this:
Invading: Knight (its a 3/2) (the other Knight was killed by the Fireball spell), Big Wolf (a 2/5)
Defending: Elf (its a 1/3)

Charlie's realm looks like this:
It's empty

TURN FOUR COMBAT:
Alice's 4/3 hits Charlie's 6/6 Dreadnaught, killing Alice's Knight. In addition, Charlie's Dreadnaught
has the Trample keyword, so the remaining 3 damage go through to Alice, killing her.

In Bob's realm, Alice's Knight hits his elf for 3, killing it (though it only has 1 health now because
Bob's elf hit it for 1). Alice's Big Wolf hits Bob for 2

In Charlie's realm, nothing happens.

After combat is finished, because Charlie killed Alice, Alice gets removed from the game. The new order of
the player line is Bob > Charlie > Bob

Also, Charlie gains his bounty for killing a prey, so he gains 1 energy for free.

Also also, the Dreadnaught that was in Alice's realm gets placed into Bob's realm as an invader

TURN FIVE SETUP:
Bob devotes a card.
Bob plays two Big Wolves protecting his realm for 5 devotion.
Charlie plays another Dreadnaught in Bob's realm for 4 devotion and 1 energy

TURN FIVE RESOLUTION:
Bob's Realm looks like this:
Invading: Knight 3/1, Big Wolf 2/5 (both left over from Alice), Dreadnaught 6/2 (was previously invading Alice), Dreadnaught 6/6 (played this turn)
Protecting: Big Wolf 2/5, Big Wolf 2/5

TURN FIVE COMBAT:
First round: Bob's Big Wolf hits Alice's Knight, killing the Knight and bringing the Big Wolf to 2/2
Second round: Alice's Big Wolf hits Bob's Frontlining Big wolf as Bob's second Big Wolf hits Alice's Big Wolf.
Bob's first Big Wolf dies and Alice's Big Wolf goes to 2/3
Third round: Bob is out of attackers, and his only remaining character is his 2/5 Big Wolf (now his frontliner).
Charlie's Dreadnaught hits the Big Wolf for 6, killing it and dealing 1 damage to Bob via Trample.
Fourth round: Charlie's second dreadnaught hits Bob for 6 undefended. Bob takes a total of 7 damage this turn
and he dies.

As Charlie is the only remaining player, Charlie wins. Go Charlie!

This is all quite a lot to keep track of, but note that players will only ever be looking at their own realm and
the realm of their prey. They will know the Hero that both ttheir hunter and prey are playing, and so they
can maybe infer what's going on in their hunter's realm, but they can't actually see it.

So, what a player sees is their own realm and their prey's realm. This is a rough mockup of what that would
look like on a phone screen:

The readout at teh bottom of the screen will also show what Hero your hunter is playing
And it will say what your Hero is and what he does

The player can also swipe left to reveal a smiilar screen, but instead of showing what
his own realm looks like, he can look at his prey's realm.
