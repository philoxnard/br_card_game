Gameplay:

This game will be a combination between a battle royale, an auto battler, and a TCG. Players will create their deck, then dive into large online lobbies against other players to see who will be the last one standing.

Every player will have their own game board, here called a realm. Each realm will contain two battle queues - one for the realm's controller, and one for the realm's invader. Players are arranged on an imaginary line - on their left will be their prey, the person whose realm they can invade, and on their right will be their predator, the person who will be invading their own realm.
