Combat basically works, so that's sweet. So does playing cards. Here are the chunks to work on:

1) Create server that does something when it has three users waiting

2) Create a sample deck and hero, just use cards you already have in your head
Zergling spell, Knight, Wall, Doombot, etc etc

3) Write code that will handle the Resolution phase

4) idk the game is basically playable after that, then figure out front end?
